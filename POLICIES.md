- Removed from public view within 24 hours
- Kept in archive for legal/fraud prevention only
- Duration: 90 days then permanent deletion
- Cannot be restored after 90 days

### Protection Mechanisms

**Visibility Controls:**

Levels:
- **Private:** Only you see it
- **Team:** You + invited team members
- **Mentors:** You + matched mentors only
- **Community:** Your sector community only
- **Public:** Everyone (for funding applications)

Default: **Private**  
User Controlled: **Yes**

**Watermarking:**

### What We Do NOT Protect

- **Patent Rights:** We don't file patents for you

- **Copyright:** Automatic, but you can register

**Recommendations:**
- Consult IP lawyer for high-value innovations
- File trademark if brand-dependent
- Consider patent for true technical innovations

**Partners:**
- **OMPIC:** Moroccan IP office - discounted services

## 4. RECEIPT VALIDATION POLICIES

### Valid Receipts

**Amount:**
- **Exact:** 3.00 DH
- **Tolerance:** 0 DH (must be exact)

**Date:**
- **Max Age:** 90 days
- **Reason:** Recent validation > old validation

**Format:**

Accepted:
- Handwritten receipt (signed + dated)
- Mobile money screenshot (Orange Money, Barid Cash, etc.)
- Digital signature (signed PDF)
- Email confirmation (if contains payment proof)

Required Elements:
- **Amount:** Clearly visible: 3 DH
- **Date:** DD/MM/YYYY format
- **Signature or Confirmation:** Name or digital proof
- **Purpose:** Optional but helpful: "Validation [idea name]"

**Validation Process:**
1. **OCR:** Automatic extraction
2. **Fraud Check:** Duplicate detection
3. **Human Review:** If confidence < 80%
4. **Approval:** Auto or manual

### Invalid Receipts

❌ Wrong amount (not 3 DH)  
❌ Too old (> 90 days)  
❌ Duplicate (same receipt uploaded twice)  
❌ Forged (Photoshopped, fake signature)  
❌ Self-signed (creator paid themselves)  
❌ Family only (> 50% from family members)  
❌ Blurry (unreadable)  
❌ Incomplete (missing date or signature)  

### Fraud Detection

**Duplicate Images:**
- **Method:** Perceptual hashing
- **Tolerance:** 98% similarity = flag

**Suspicious Patterns:**
- All receipts same day (> 20 on same day)
- All receipts same handwriting (> 30 identical)
- All receipts same location (GPS metadata shows same device)
- Rapid submission (> 50 in 1 hour)

**Consequences:**
- **First Offense:** Warning + receipts removed

- **Third Offense:** Permanent ban + all ideas removed

**Appeals:**
- **Allowed:** Yes
- **Process:** Submit evidence + explanation
- **Review Time:** 48 hours
- **Independent Reviewer:** Yes

### Gamification Concern

**Problem:** Users might game receipts

**Mitigations:**
- Human review threshold: Flag if > 100 receipts
- Velocity checks: Flag if 50+ receipts in 24 hours
- Quality over quantity: 10 receipts with rich context > 100 generic
- Intimacy score required: Must have lived experience (Locke)
- Spot audits: Random 5% sample checked thoroughly

---

## 5. SCORING & QUALIFICATION POLICIES

### Transparency

**Algorithm Published:** Yes  
**Location:** https://fikravalley.ma/scoring-methodology

**User Sees:**
- Current score (real-time)
- Score breakdown (Clarity, Decision, Intimacy)
- Gaps (exactly what's missing)
- Potential score (if gaps filled)

**User Does NOT See:**
- Other users' scores (private)
- Ranking (no public leaderboard)
- Reviewer identities (anonymous)

### Objectivity

**Automated Scoring:** 70% of total score  
**Human Review:** 30% (clarity, feasibility subjective parts)

**Bias Prevention:**
- Remove names (reviewers don't see creator name)
- Remove location (don't see city to avoid urban bias)
- Remove gender markers (neutral presentation)
- Diverse reviewer pool (mix of backgrounds, sectors)

**Calibration:**
- **Frequency:** Weekly
- **Method:** Random 10% double-reviewed
- **Consistency Target:** > 90% inter-rater reliability

### Qualification Tiers

| Tier | Score Range | Intilaka Eligible | Probability |
|------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Unqualified** | < 15/50 | ❌ No | 5% |
| **Developing** | 15-19/50 | ❌ No | 15% |
| **Promising** | 20-24/50 | ❌ No | 35% |
| **Qualified** | 25-31/50 | ✅ Yes | 60-70% |
| **Exceptional** | ≥ 32/50 | ✅ Yes | 80-90% |

### Communication

**Tone:** Always constructive and hopeful

❌ **Bad Example:** "Your idea is not good enough"  
✅ **Good Example:** "You're at 22/50 (Promising). 3 more points → Qualified!"

### Appeals

**Allowed:** Yes

**Valid Grounds:**
- Factual error (reviewer missed something)
- Technical misunderstanding (reviewer didn't understand domain)
- Bias suspected (evidence of unfair treatment)

**NOT Allowed:**
- Disagree with score (subjective disagreement)
- Want higher score (without new evidence)

**Process:**
- Submit appeal with specific claims
- Independent review (different reviewer)
- Final decision within 5 business days
- **Binding:** Yes

### Locke Requirements

**Intimacy Minimum:** 5/10 intimacy score required for "Qualified"  
**Reason:** Cannot fund someone who just "knows OF" problem

**Override:**
- **If:** Clarity > 9/10 AND Decision > 35/40
- **And:** Receipts > 200
- **Then:** Qualify despite low intimacy (market proven)

## 8. VIRAL MECHANICS - Making Success Contagious

### 1. The Hope Engine

**Philosophy:** "Hope is contagious. Success inspires action."

**Locke Connection:**
> "When you SEE someone like you succeed, you don't just 'know OF' success.  
> You BELIEVE success is possible for you.  
> This is INTIMATE knowledge of possibility."

**Real-Time Wins:**

Broadcast small wins across platform:
- "Youssef from Fès just collected his 10th receipt! 🎉"
- "Amina's intimacy score jumped from 4 → 7 this week! 🧠"
- "Karim just qualified for Intilaka (score: 28/50)! ✅"
- "Fatima's idea got matched with 2 expert mentors! 🎓"

**Frequency:** Every 5-10 minutes during peak hours  
**Location:** Top banner (dismissible), feed, notifications

**Psychology:**
- Social proof (others are doing it)
- Attainability (small, specific wins)
- Progress (not just outcomes, process wins)
- Identification (real names, real cities)

**Success Counter (Homepage):**
- Total ideas: 1,247 submitted
- Qualified ideas: 347 for funding
- Receipts collected: 23,456 = 23,456 conversations
- Funding secured: 28 ideas (12.4M DH total)
