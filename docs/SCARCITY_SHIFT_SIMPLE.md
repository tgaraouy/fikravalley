# Scarcity Shift: Simple Guide for Moroccan Entrepreneurs

## 🎯 One Core Insight

**When AI makes expertise cheap, value migrates to what AI can't do: Local Trust & Moroccan Execution.**

---

## 🇲🇦 The 2 New Scarcities in Morocco

### 1. **Local Trust & Relationships**
- AI can't replicate **trust networks** (family, neighborhood, community)
- AI can't build **reputation** (word-of-mouth, WhatsApp forwards)
- **Premium:** Ideas that leverage local relationships

**Example:** Food delivery where "driver is your neighbor" (trust) > AI route optimization

### 2. **Moroccan Execution**
- AI can't handle **2G/offline** reality
- AI can't coordinate **mobile money + cash** payments
- AI can't navigate **PDPL compliance** in practice
- AI can't manage **diaspora relationships** (remittances, family)
- **Premium:** Ideas that require Moroccan-specific execution

**Example:** EdTech with offline courses + mobile money + Darija > AI-generated content

---

## ✅ Simple Framework

### Ask 2 Questions:

1. **"Can AI do this better/cheaper?"**
   - YES → **Avoid** (value is leaving)
   - NO → **Consider**

2. **"Does this require Moroccan trust/execution?"**
   - YES → **Pursue** (value is here)
   - NO → **Rethink**

### The Sweet Spot:

**Ideas that combine:**
- ✅ Local Trust (relationships, community)
- ✅ Moroccan Execution (2G, mobile money, cash, PDPL)

**These are protected from AI disruption.**

## 🚀 Action: Update Idea Evaluation

Add 2 scores to each idea:

1. **Local Trust Score (0-10):** How much does this rely on local relationships/trust?
2. **Moroccan Execution Score (0-10):** How much does this require Moroccan-specific execution?

**Ideas with high scores (7+) in both = Protected from AI disruption**

---

## 💡 Example

### Food Delivery Platform:

**❌ Old Scarcity (Cheap Now):**
- Route optimization (AI does this)
- Order processing (AI does this)

**✅ New Scarcity (Where Value Is):**
- **Local Trust:** "Driver is your neighbor" (AI can't replicate)
- **Moroccan Execution:** Cash + mobile money + 2G + Casablanca traffic (AI can't do this)

**Result:** Value migrates to **trust** and **execution**, not optimization.

---

## 🔑 Key Takeaway

**Focus on:**
- Building **trust networks** (your moat)
- Mastering **Moroccan execution** (your advantage)

**Avoid:**
- Competing with AI on generic expertise
- Building features AI can do better

**🇲🇦 Keep it simple: Build trust. Execute locally. That's where value is.**
