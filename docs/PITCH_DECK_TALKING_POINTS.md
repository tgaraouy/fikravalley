## HANDLING QUESTIONS

### "How do you compete with existing platforms?"
> "We're not competing on features. We're competing on understanding. We understand Moroccan languages, culture, and market. That's our moat."

### "What's your defensibility?"
> "Three things: 1) Multi-language voice processing (hard to replicate), 2) Moroccan context training (data advantage), 3) Network effects (more users = better matching)."

### "How do you acquire users?"
> "Three channels: 1) Universities (direct partnerships), 2) WhatsApp (viral sharing), 3) Bank partnerships (Intilaka integration). Low CAC of $5."

### "What's your biggest risk?"
> "Adoption risk. Will Moroccans use voice? We've validated this with user research - 70% prefer voice. But we need to prove it at scale."

### "Why now?"
> "Three trends: 1) AI is ready (Claude API), 2) Morocco's startup ecosystem is growing, 3) Voice technology is mature. Perfect timing."
