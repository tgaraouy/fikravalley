## 🇲🇦 Moroccan Context: Digital Transformation

### What "Digital" Means in Morocco:

**Challenges:**
- 2G/3G connectivity (offline-first needed)

- Low digital literacy in some areas

**Opportunities:**
- High smartphone penetration
- Mobile money adoption (M-Wallet, Orange Money)
- WhatsApp/Facebook usage
- GenZ tech-savvy
- Diaspora digital access

### Digital Transformation for Ideas:

**From:**
- ❌ Ideas stuck in people's heads
- ❌ Ideas shared only verbally (WhatsApp voice, in-person)
- ❌ No tracking, no validation, no improvement

**To:**
- ✅ Ideas captured digitally (voice → text → structured)
- ✅ Ideas trackable (progress, traction, experiments)
- ✅ Ideas shareable (founders, mentors, investors)
- ✅ Ideas improvable (AI analysis, feedback loops)
