**THE CHALLENGE: GREAT IDEAS DIE UNTESTED**

Moroccan entrepreneurs face 3 critical barriers:

**Validation Gap**
- 90% of ideas fail because they're not validated before building.
- Market research is expensive ($5K-10K) and hard to access.

**Language Barriers**
- Traditional platforms only support English/French.
- 70% of Moroccans prefer voice over typing (Darija/Tamazight).

**Mentor Access**
- Limited local mentorship; diaspora expertise remains untapped.
- No structured matching system.

**Market Context:**
- Despite ecosystem growth ($94.96M raised in 2024, tripling from 2023), individual rounds remain small.
- Morocco lags behind Nigeria/Kenya in aggregate funding.
- 74% internet penetration creates massive untapped opportunity.
